# To use this class include the following lines of code in your desired php script eg the index.php file
# 
 include('classes/Errors.class.php');
 if (ERR_HANDLER_ENABLED) {
   register_shutdown_function('sysFatalErr');
   set_error_handler('sysErrorhandler');
 }
# 
* This class gets all the errors reported by a php script
* it then classifies them as either fatal or non-fatal according to the error codes
* After an error has been classified it is passed to the respective method:: generalErr,fatalErr
* which then passes the error string and the file to write to to a function log()
# 
* function log() calls the write() funtion which writes or appends the errors into the respective file
* function raStr() adds a random string to the file name improving security for someone trying to access the files from the browser
* if you have a .htaccess file in your log folder the raStr() will be unnecessary.
# 
* The error reporting of this class is set to E_ALL which reports all errors except E_STRICT errors
* you can change that in error_reporting() to your desired but changing this will need a change in the main functions

<h2>PHP ERROR CODES</h2>
<ul> 
<li>E_ERROR 1 fatal runtime error that can be recovered, The execution of the script is stopped immediately</li>
<li>E_WARNING 2 a runtime warning,not fatal and most errors fall here, executiion is not stopped</li>
<li>E_PARSE 4 compile time error,generated by the parser</li>
<li>E_NOTICE 8 runtime notice indicating something that could possibly be an error was encountered when running a script normally</li>
<li>E_CORE_ERROR 16 fatal error that occur during php engine initial startup generated by the core.</li>
<li>E_COMPILE_ERROR 64 fatal errror that occurs while the scriot was being compiled generated by the Zend Scripting engine</li>
<li>E_USER_ERROR 256 a fatal user generated error, generated by the php code using the function trigger_error() rather than the php engine</li>
<li>E_USER_WARNING 512 NON FATAL USER GENERATED WAR MESSAGE, generated by the php code using the function trigger_error() rather than the php engine</li>
<li>E_USER_NOTICE 1024 user generated notice message, generated by the php code using the function trigger_error() rather than the php engine</li>
<li>E_STRICT 2048 Not strictly an error but its triggered whenever php encounters code that could lead to problems or forwad incopatibilities</li>
<li>E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR 4096 A catchable fatal error, although fatal it does not leave the php engine in an unstable state, if the error is not caught the application abborts as it   was an E_ERROR</li>
<li>E_ALL 32767 All errors and warnings except of level E_STRICT</li>
<li>TIP: pssing value (-1) to the error_reporting() function will show every possible error when new levels and constants are added in future php versions</li>
</ul>
